Used_Car_Price_Prediction
==============================
In this project, I aim to predict the selling price of used cars using various independent variables. 
To achieve this, I compared the performance of two regression models: a Linear Regression model and a 
Random Forest Regression model. After evaluating both models, I found that the Random Forest Regression 
model achieved a higher RÂ² score, making it the superior choice for this task. Consequently, I selected 
the Random Forest Regression model as the best model for predicting used car prices.
